## GitHub

- Repository URL: (paste your repo URL here)

## Implemented Features / Status
-  One-line board with bonus squares (DW + DL)
-  7 random tiles drawn from the Scrabble distribution (100-tile bag)
-  Drag tiles from rack onto board squares (jQuery UI draggable/droppable)
-  Invalid drops (revert)
-  After the first tile, all tiles must be placed nearby (no gaps)
-  Tiles can be moved back to the rack
-  Restart game resets everything


## Things that were not implemented that would be nice to have:

- Full Scrabble board 
- Dictionary checker / word validation
- Blank tile (“_”) wildcard letter selection (blank is just a 0-point tile)
- Tile swapping (discard rack and redraw without restarting)

- Board/tile graphics: provided in homework zip
